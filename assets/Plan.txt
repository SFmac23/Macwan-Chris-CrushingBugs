# Bug Fix Assignment â€“ Drag and Drop Game
 Chris Macwan

## ðŸ”§ Overview
This plan outlines the bugs identified in the original drag-and-drop game, their root causes, and the exact code-level solutions applied to fix them. Two core bugs were resolved, and the code was cleaned up for better UX and logic. All changes were committed using proper Git branching.

Bug #1: Multiple Labels Allowed in One Drop Zone

# Problem:
Each `.target-zone` was allowing multiple labels to be dropped, stacking them inside â€” which should not happen.

# Fix:
Modified the `drop()` function to check if the drop zone is already occupied:

-> js
if (this.children.length === 0) {
    this.appendChild(currentDraggedElement);
}

# Bug #2: Reset Button Did Not Restore Labels

# Problem:
After dragging labels into the target zones, there was no working Reset button to move them back. The board could not be reused or restarted without refreshing the page.

# Fix:
- Added a `.reset-btn` click event listener
- For each `.target-zone`, checked if it contains a child
- If yes, removed the child and created a new `.label` div with the same content
- Set `draggable = true` and re-attached the `dragstart` event
- Appended the recreated label back to `#label-box`

-> js
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
newDiv.className = "label";
newDiv.textContent = target.firstChild.textContent;
newDiv.draggable = true;
newDiv.addEventListener("dragstart", dragStart);
labelBox.appendChild(newDiv);
target.removeChild(target.firstChild);
